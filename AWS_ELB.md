    - Scroll down to the field **User data**.
    - Copy the following code and paste it into the **User data** field.
      ```text
      #!/bin/bash
      yum update -y
      yum -y install httpd
      systemctl enable httpd
      systemctl start httpd
      echo '<html><h1>Hello World! This is server 1.</h1></html>' > /var/www/html/index.html
      ```
      ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/efe903f8-d2a1-44dc-b53e-a890e8eefbea)

      - This script does the following:
        - Updates the server
        - Installs an Apache web server (httpd)
        - Configures the web server to automatically start on boot
        - Starts the web server
        - Creates a simple webpage 
11. Choose **Launch instance** .
12. On the next screen, Choose **View all instances**.
    ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/73fa8255-9e40-4487-a941-47e964aed2f0)

13. Before you continue, wait for your instance to display the following:
    - **Instance state**:  Running
    - **Status check**:  2/2 checks passed
    - **Tip**: To refresh the instance information,  choose the refresh  icon.


### Task 2. Access your EC2 instanceâ€™s website
- In this task, you will access the content from the web server on the EC2 instance that you just created.
14. Select the **Web Server 1** instance that you created earlier in this lab.
15. In the **Details** tab copy the **Public IPv4 address** of your instance, then open a new tab in your web browser and paste in and load the address.
    - It should display the web server page with the message *Hello World! This is server 1.**
    - **Note**: If web page is not displayed, ensure that you are accessing page using http:// (not https://).


### Task 3. Create a second EC2 instance for load balancing
- In this task, you will create a second EC2 instance so that you will later be able to configure load balancing between the two instances.
16. Return to the **EC2 Management Console** browser tab.
17. Select the **Web Server 1** instance.
18. From the **Actions** menu, choose Images and templates****, then choose **Launch more like this**
    ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/4de188b5-1924-4916-ada7-3c269283fecc)

    - A **Launch an instance** page opens.
19. In the **Name and tags** pane, change the Name to `Web Server 2`.
    ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/19c936a3-1315-4e91-b116-0ff78acf48ac)

20. In the **Key pair (login)** section, from the **Key pair name** - ***required*** dropdown list, choose **vockey**.
    ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/a0da4e90-e6e0-451b-ab59-b0a5f9e6e9cf)

21. From the **Subnet** dropdown list, choose the existing subnet in **Availability Zone us-east-1b.**
    ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/0df784d5-332d-42a2-a73d-40a4fcb7582b)

22. Scroll down, and expand the **Advanced Details** section, then scroll down to the **User data** field.
23. Use copy and paste to replace the existing code with the code shown below.
    ```text
    #!/bin/bash
    yum update -y
    yum -y install httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    echo '<html><h1>Hello World! This is server 2.</h1></html>' > /var/www/html/index.html
    ```
    ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/944a039f-52a1-429b-add7-c3513ada0d13)

    - **Note**: This script is almost the same as the one that you used for the first instance. However, notice that it says *This is server 2*. The text that displays when you access Web Server 2 will be different than the text of Web Server 1. When you access the instances through the load balancer, this difference in text is how you will know which instance is displayed.
24. Choose **Launch instance** .
25. On the next screen, Choose **View all instances**.
26. Before you continue, wait for your instance to display the following:
    - **Instance state**:  Running
    - **Status check**:  2/2 checks passed
      ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/6ae03054-a31b-4c52-8971-ffa1318b7023)

    - **Tip**: To refresh the instance information, choose the refresh  icon.


### Task 4. Access the website on the second EC2 instance
27. Select the **Web Server 2** instance.
28. In the **Details** tab copy the **Public IPv4 address** of your instance, then open a new tab in your web browser and paste in and load the address.
29. This will open a new tab in your web browser and display the web server page with the message _Hello World! This is server 2_.
    - Make a note of the _Availability Zones_ where the **Web Server 1** and **Web Server 2** instances are running. For example, **us-east-1a** and **us-east-1b**. You will need this information in the next task.


### Task 5. Create a load balancer
30. Back in the EC2 console, in the left navigation pane, under **Load Balancing**, choose **Load Balancers**.

    ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/e3d393f4-56af-438a-95a1-abdd10f0a139)

    - Before continuing, ensure that the **State** of the load balancer that you just created changes to _Active_.
      ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/a353ce9a-80ed-4a77-981e-eba064b0923d)

    - It can take a few minutes for it to become active.
    - **Tip**: To refresh the load balancer information, choose the refresh  icon.


### Task 6. Test the load balancer
- In this task, you will test the load balancer that you just created.
48. Select the load balancer that you just created, and expand the **Details** section.
49. Under **Details**, copy the **DNS name** value to your clipboard.
    ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/d00cd710-6ba1-4bda-8a2f-c1a372e66475)

50. Open a new tab in your web browser, paste the DNS name that you just copied, and press **Enter**.
    - If your load balancer is working, the _Hello World!_ message displays. Notice whether the message says _This is server 1_ or _This is server 2_.
    ![image](https://github.com/swatipal1010/AWS_services_hands_on/assets/110754474/1be8acd0-3fe4-4386-8a67-bd6ab17eb658)

51. Refresh the browser tab a few times.
    - Notice when the message changes between _This is server 1_ and _This is server 2_. When the message changes, it means that the load balancer has directed you to the web server on the other EC2 instance that you created in this lab.
