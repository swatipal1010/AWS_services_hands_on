## Amazon Elastic BeanStalk and Amazon CloudFormation
### Create an application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Also use a template and AWS CloudFormation to build a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

### Task 1. Deploy an application using Elastic Beanstalk
1. Choose the **Services** menu, locate the **Compute** services, and choose **Elastic Beanstalk**.
2. Choose **Create Application**.
3. For **Application name**, enter a name for your application; for example, `MyLabApp`
4. For **Platform**, select **PHP**.
5. For **Application code**, select **Sample application**.
6. Choose **Next**.
7. Under **Existing service roles** choose the drop-down and select **EMR_EC2_DefaultRole**.
8. Under **EC2 key pair** choose the drop-down and select **vockey**.
9. Under **EC2 instance profile** choose the drop-down and select **EMR_EC2_DefaultRole**.
10. Choose **Next**.
11. Under **VPC** select the **available VPC**.
12. Under **Public IP address** select **Activated**.
13. Under **Instance subnets** select at least two.
14. Choose **Next**.
15. Under **EC2 Security groups** select the **default**.
16. Choose **Next**.
17. Under **Health reporting** choose **Basic**.
18. Under **Managed updates** de-select **Activated**.
19. Choose **Next**.
20. Choose **Submit**.
    - Watch the console as Elastic Beanstalk creates and runs the necessary resources to run the application. It takes 5-10 minutes for the process to complete.
    - Elastic Beanstalk creates an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) storage bucket and a security group, launches an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, and runs the code.
    - When complete, the screen changes to show the newly created environment. It is ready for you to upload a PHP application.
21. Open a new browser tab or window. Navigate to the AWS Tutorials and Samples web page.
22. On the page, in the second list of downloads, find **PHP â€“ php.zip**. Download the sample **PHP** application to your computer.
    - ou should now have a file called _php.zip_.
23. Return to the Elastic Beanstalk console tab.
24. Choose **Upload and deploy**.
25. Choose **Choose file**, navigate to and select the **php.zip** file that you downloaded, and choose **Open**.
26. Choose **Deploy**.
    - The application deploys to the environment using all of the cloud resources Elastic Beanstalk provisioned.
27. To see your PHP website, in the left navigation pane, choose **Go to environment**.
    - The web application opens in a new tab.


### Task 2. Deploy an application using CloudFormation
28. Return to the AWS Management Console tab.
29. Choose the **Services** menu, locate the **Compute** services, and choose **EC2**.
30. In th left navigation pane, under **Network & Security**, choose **Key Pairs**.
31. Choose **Create key pair**.
32. For **Name**, enter `CFLearner`
33. Choose **Create key pair**.
34. When the download window opens, choose **Cancel**. You do not need to download the file.
35. Choose the **Services** menu, locate the **Management & Governance** services, and choose **CloudFormation**.
   - The **Stacks** list appears and displays the CloudFormation stacks that were created in your lab environment. Notice the stack whose **Description** says _AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment_. This stack was created automatically when you deployed your application through Elastic Beanstalk.
   - This demonstrates how the two services work together to create an environment to run your code.
36. Choose **Create stack**, and then choose **With new resources (standard)**.
37. In the **Prerequisite** section, choose **Use a sample template**.
38. In the **Select a sample template** section, select **WordPress blog**.
    - WordPress is web software that you can use to create a website or blog. This template installs a highly available and scalable WordPress deployment using an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database instance for storage.
39. Select **Next**.
40. For **Stack name**, enter `WordPressStack`
41. In the **Parameters** section, configure the following:
    - **DBPassword:** Enter `Testing1 ` 
    - **DBUser:** Enter `testadmin`
    - **KeyName:** Choose the **CFLearner** key pair
42. Choose **Next**, and then choose **Next** again.
    - You will use the default stack options.
43. Review the stack configuration, and then choose **Submit**.
    - This initiates the deployment of the resources. You can watch the CloudFormation stack events on the **Events** tab as a complete WordPress site is created.
